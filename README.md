 <h2>React Dictionary App</h2>
 <p> This is a Reactjs project focused on creating a simple, user-friendly design with seamless word-search functionality.</p>
 <h2> Installation and Set-up Instructions</h2>
 <p>Clone down this repository you will need <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code> installed globally on your machine.</p>
 <h5>Installation</h5>
 <p><code>npm install</code></p>
 <h5>To Start Server</h5>
 <p><code>npm start</code></p>
 <h2> Reflection</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>Single Responsibility Principle</li>
  <li>React Components</li>
  <li>React Loops</li>
  <li>API Integration</li>
  <li>Responsive Design</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I learned so many new things by creating this coding project. My end goal of this project was to create a fully functional dictionary app that included basic features like the definition, part of speech, synonyms, phonetic spelling and (if possible) an audio button and image section. My first step was to create a wireframe on InvisionApp, which you can view <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81705490/123295107-4f7fd180-d50d-11eb-8db2-53295f31a16e.png" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>While building this application, I learned how to search for the APIs that were right for getting my desired end result, create specific components, use React Loops, and Use States.</p>
<p>The main challenges of the project were creating more components, so the application could parse through the different aspects of the complex API and stay true to the Single Responsibility Principle. It was also important to me to display the audio player of the phonetics in the most user-friendly and accessible way, so I wanted this elemento play whilst the user was still on the application, rather than this feature opening up into a different tab, so installing <code>react-audio-player</code> helped me achieve this goal. </p>
